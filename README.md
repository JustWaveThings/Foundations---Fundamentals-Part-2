# Foundations---Fundamentals-Part-2
Foundations
FUNDAMENTALS PART 1 - Activities complete, but I utilized the in browser interactive examples / codepen.io so you'll need to take my word for it.

Foundations
FUNDAMENTALS PART 2 - Moving all work to github, every bit of code from now on will be in vscode and pushed to github. It will be in it's own repo.
