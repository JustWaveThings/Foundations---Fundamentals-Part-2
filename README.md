# Foundations---Fundamentals-Part-2
Foundations
FUNDAMENTALS PART 1 - Activities complete, but I utilized the in browser interactive examples / codepen.io so you'll need to take my word for it.

#update - I went back as a refresher after a break in learning and now all the exercises are on Github

Foundations
FUNDAMENTALS PART 2 - Moving all work to github, every bit of code from now on will be in vscode and pushed to github. It will be in it's own repo. 

The repos created in this section of The Odin Project will be prefixed with "FFP2-" and a concise description.
